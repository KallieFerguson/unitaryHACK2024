# QuantumToolbox


## Introduction

[QuantumToolbox.jl](https://github.com/albertomercurio/QuantumToolbox.jl) is a cutting-edge Julia package designed for quantum physics simulations, closely emulating the popular Python [QuTiP](https://github.com/qutip/qutip) package. It uniquely combines the simplicity and power of Julia with advanced features like GPU acceleration and distributed computing, making simulation of quantum systems more accessible and efficient.

## Features

QuantumToolbox.jl is equipped with a robust set of features:

- **Quantum State and Operator Manipulation:** Easily handle quantum states and operators with a rich set of tools.

- **Dynamical Evolution:** Advanced solvers for time evolution of quantum systems.

- **Measurement and Statistics:** Comprehensive quantum measurement simulation and analysis.

- **GPU and Distributed Computing:** Leverage GPU and distributed resources for high-performance computing.

## Installation

```julia

using Pkg

Pkg.add("QuantumToolbox")
